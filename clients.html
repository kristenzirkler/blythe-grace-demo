Their energy level was strong and they displayed passion for getting the job done right. I would have no problem hiring Blythe Grace again.</p>

      <p><strong>Although we work with several foreign law firms</strong> because we have operations throughout Europe and Asia, Blythe Grace handles the majority of our legal needs in the United States. From advising us on employment matters, helping us negotiate contracts, and defending us against threats of litigation, Blythe Grace has always been there for our company.  The firm is a trusted resource and a valued business partner. We highly recommend them.</p>

      <p><strong>I was referred to Mr. Reder at Blythe Grace by a previous client of his</strong> and was told simply "He is the best around"...I can now personally say that statement is 110% true for him and his staff. "THEY ARE THE BEST" plain and simple. I recommend their services to anyone who should need them.</p>

      <p><strong>I had a great experience that was very different than prior experiences...</strong> I felt that most firms overcharged and under-delivered. Robert was very upfront with me about what approach he would take and he delivered in every area. I always knew where I stood and was given information for consideration and I was allowed to make the decisions I thought were best for me. We had a very successful outcome in my case.<br><br>I have recommended and will continue to recommend Blythe Grace to whomever I meet that needs a great law firm</p>

      <p><strong>We needed an attorney to help us organize our company...</strong> We were looking for representation that not only had a strong knowledge of business operations and structure, but also possessed strong entrepreneurial business acumen, so they could not just represent us from a legal perspective, but also a strategic one. After working with Blythe Grace, we have a great sense of peace that our legal structuring is all in order and we can focus totally on running our business.</p>
