      <p><strong>I had the pleasure of working with Blythe Grace for over three years on a very complex lawsuit.</strong> They were always professional and respectful of my time and money that was being spent. Their energy level was strong and they displayed passion for getting the job done right. I would have no problem hiring Blythe Grace again.</p>

      <p><strong>I had the pleasure of meeting Robert through a colleague of mine.</strong> After our first call, I knew I wanted to work with him and the team. Blythe Grace assisted us with employee relations, final wage disputes and employment law changes, updates and best practices. They not only provided us with quick solutions, but also with options, and supported us with decisions that best fit our Company and our culture. Blythe Grace cares about their clients, and most importantly, they are honest and upfront- no sugar coating here. We definitely recommend Blythe Grace, without hesitation.</p>

      <p><strong>I was referred to Blythe Grace by a previous client of Robert's</strong> and was told simply "He is the best around"...I can now personally say that statement is 110% true for him and his staff. "THEY ARE THE BEST" plain and simple. I recommend their services to anyone who should need them.</p>

      <p><strong>I had a great experience that was very different than prior experiences...</strong> I felt that most firms overcharged and under-delivered. Blythe Grace was very upfront with me about what approach they would take and they delivered in every area. I always knew where I stood and was given information for consideration and I was allowed to make the decisions I thought were best for me. We had a very successful outcome in my case.<br><br>I have recommended and will continue to recommend Blythe Grace to whomever I meet that needs a great law firm.</p>
