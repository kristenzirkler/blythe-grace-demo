      <p>Blythe Grace PLLC has formed an alliance with <a href="http://www.rsalawaz.com/" target="_blank">Robert Stewart & Associates</a> bringing over three decades of combined legal expertise to clients with a particular emphasis on the areas of commercial and employment litigation, dispute resolution, trial practice, employment law and counseling, corporate representation (formations, governance, mergers and acquisitions, disputes), and start up and general business counseling.</p>

      <p>Blythe Grace is located in Scottsdale, Arizona and Robert Stewart & Associates is located in Phoenix, Arizona allowing the firms to provide services all over the Valley, statewide, and nationally for their clients.</p>

      <p>Robert S. Reder, the managing partner of Blythe Grace, and Robert L. Stewart, Jr., the managing partner of Robert Stewart & Associates, were both trained at the Valley's most prestigious firms, but shared a view that the upside of working in a small firm alliance - such as lower rates and a more focused and personal client interaction - presented a distinct advantage in the attorney-client experience.</p>

      <p>With their associated practices, the Blythe Grace / Robert Stewart & Associates alliance provides clients with cost effective and efficient representation without sacrificing the timeliness and quality of legal work.  We genuinely enjoy and value what we do, take pleasure in helping all of our clients, large and small, and are always available when you contact us.</p>
